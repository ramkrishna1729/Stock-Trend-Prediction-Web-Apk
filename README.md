# Stock-Trend-Prediction-Web-Apk
The repository aims to provide a comprehensive solution for predicting stock prices using deep learning techniques (LSTM) while incorporating the mean average of historical data.

1. LSTM Model: Utilizes Long Short-Term Memory neural networks, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN), for stock price prediction. LSTM is known for its ability to capture long-term dependencies in sequential data, making it suitable for time series forecasting like stock prices.

2. Mean Average: In addition to the LSTM model, this project incorporates the concept of the mean average of historical stock price data. This statistical measure can provide valuable insights and help in improving prediction accuracy.

3. Web Scraping: Data for stock prices is obtained from Yahoo Finance through web scraping. Yahoo Finance is a popular source for historical stock price data and financial information.

4. Streamlit: The application is hosted and presented to users using Streamlit. Streamlit is a Python library for creating web applications with minimal effort. It simplifies the process of turning data scripts into shareable web apps.

Functionality:
Input the stock name and preferences for the stock prediction model.
View historical stock price data obtained through web scraping.
Explore stock price predictions generated by the LSTM model.
Analyze mean average statistics to make informed decisions.

5. Workflow:
   The application begins by fetching historical stock price data from Yahoo Finance using web scraping techniques.
   The retrieved data is preprocessed and prepared for analysis.
   The LSTM model, which has been trained on historical stock data, generates predictions based on user inputs and preferences.
   These trends are displayed to the user alongside the mean average graphs for a comprehensive overview.
